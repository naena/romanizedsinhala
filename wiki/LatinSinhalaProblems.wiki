= Sinhala letters will be only visible in formatted text = 

In order to display Sinhala letters along with English, you will need to use a text editor that supports text formatting. For instance, you cannot use Notepad to display both English and Sinhala words at the same time in a paragraph.

and manually change the words in a proper Text Editor.
