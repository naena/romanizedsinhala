The origin of a language should be only of academic and historic interest. However, the origin of Sinhala has been brought into the political debate, so much so that it is being used to lay claim to land. There is no doubt that Sinhala is indigenous only to Lanka and Maldives. The question is who gave us Sinhala.

Fundamental question is what is Sinhala? I wonder what I think as Sinhala is same as the Sinhala you, my reader, think it is. My own idea changed gradually as I researched into it. The approach here is to take you on a path of scientific inquiry.
To prime you, let me retell the fabled story of the drunkard and the street lamp. The scene is a drunkard crawling under a street lamp searching for something. A passer by stops and asks what he was searching for. The drunkard says that he’s looking for his keys. The other man asks “Did you lose them here?” The drunkard says, “No, but the light is only here!”

I submit that we might have been searching in the wrong place – the theories of the past.

# Hard part is to overcome die-hard beliefs #

When you go against the conventional wisdom they shoot the messenger and ignore the message. This happened to me trying to tell that Sinhala shouldn’t be allowed to be trapped into Unicode’s double-octet code-point scheme that would put it in a permanent backseat status in the cyber world. Now the results of the calamity are there for everyone to see.

There are two hypotheses about the origin of Sinhala. One is that Sinhala is a sister language of the Northern Indian languages called the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European languages. The other does not oppose it but says that before Sinhala came to look like an Indo-European language, it must have been a Dravidian language.

# The answer, my friend, is blowing in your wind #

There is living evidence that disproves both these theories. In other words, though disappointing to the urban pundits, we do not need to beg our former masters to find it for us or launch a wasteful committee of inquiry. The Sinhalese display it every time they speak! In this experiment, you are the scientist and your speech is the subject.
To help you on your way, I need for you to gather courage to think critically and be objective. It is like ‘sarama kæhæpotagahagena vædata bahinavaa’, that we, who have now aged, used to do before getting down to do something that needs serious effort. So, I need to ask your benevolent permission to use Romanized Sinhala. At the bottom are the non-English letters in romanized Sinhala provided for your reference.

# Hodiya is no simple alphabet: It’s a wonderment #

Sinhala is called a syllabic language. That means its speakers can write pretty much anything they speak and read even nonsense without prior prompting. Sinhala has an alphabet, better called a hodiya. Mixed Sinhala Hodiya (mizra síhala hoodiya) rivals the IPA phonetic chart. An alphabet is simply a listing of symbols used to write something. A hodiya is way more than that. If you study Sinhala hodiya enough you’d figure that you could even explain Tamil and English sounds in relation to the Sinhala hodiya.

Sinhala hodiya is a mix of Sanskrit, Pali and Sinhala. Sinhala was the last addition to the hodiya. Notice how they improvised æyanna from ayanna (it does not have its own unique shape), and long forms of ‘e’ and ‘o’ (the unusual use of hal kiriima). These three sounds have no assigned written forms in Sanskrit or Pali. In fact, no Indic language has the æyanna. (Sound of ‘a’ in hat). For that matter, few Indo-European languages have the æ sound that English and Sinhala are abound with. The hodiya probably came with Buddhism, and Sinhala was accommodated inside the Sanskrit alphabet already extended for Pali by the addition of muurðhaja layanna.

The unblemished Sinhala hodiya is the original Sanskrit hodiya as immediately added with Sinhala. It is found in Sinhala grammar books published earlier to independence. It is a chart of rows of phonemes, numbering fifty eight, arranged methodically and precisely.
The first two/three rows are vowels (svara – paµakuru). Each row is arranged according to the backness of the vowel starting with sounds made at the back of the mouth progressively moving forward. There are eighteen vowels.

Next are consonants (vyaçjana – gaþakuru). First they are classified into blocks according to the manner of articulation (sparxaakxara, stops; anþäsþhaakxara, approximants; uuxmaakxara, fricatives). The stops are further ordered into rows according to the place of articulation (kaµthaja, velar; þaaluja, palatal; muurðhaja, coronal; ðanþaja, dental; oxthaja, labial) and finally, each row according to phonation (ghoxa, voice; mahapraaµa, aspiration; and anunaasika haa sanyaka, post and pre nasalization). There are forty consonants. The sanyakas were not in the older hodiyas in the block of stops. They were described in grammar.

You could create the hodiya yourself. First get the Sanskrit hodiya. It is consistently the same wherever you find it. Then add to it æyanna, ææyanna following aayanna; add eeyanna and ooyanna following their short forms; add sanyaka gayanna, sanyaka dayanna, sanyaka ðayanna and amba bayanna at end of the rows starting with kayanna, tayanna, þayanna, and payanna respctively. Finally, add muurðhaja layanna after hayanna. I prefer to give it its own solitary row. Do not bother about sanyaka jayanna and þaaluja sanyuga naasikyaya. They do not belong in the hodiya. They are doubled consonants. Post colonial hodiyas have them added due to ignorance.

# Romanizing helps #

First, few words on romanizing: See the citation given next from Mahaavamsa flawlessly done in Latin characters. I could have typed everything said here in Sinhala language right on this computer without having to massacre it as we do daily by anglicizing. Anglicizing means writing like this: Sri Lanka, Rajapaksa, Kegalla, Udagama. They are ambivalent in pronunciation, which is un-Sinhala. Sinhala is syllabic and writing should follow speech. (Romanized Sinhala: zri lákaa, raajapaksa, kæægalla, udagama / uðaagama). This is not unusual for languages that use Latin letters. Dutch and Italian are two examples of languages written this way. Sinhala orthography has rules to overcome some difficulties in bringing writing and speech together such as where ‘a’ is pronounced and where it is a schwa.

Getting back to the topic, the following closing paragraph is found at the end of chapter 14 of Mahavamsa.
## Romanized Sinhala ##
"lákaava pihituviimehi hoo aðhika kota þæbiimehi zaasþû kenekugee aakaara æþi lakðivata pahanak
baÐu vuu ee mahaa sþhavira þemee mesee ðe þænek hi ðii heøaðiv basin ðaham vaðaaraa lakðiv væsi
janayaa kerehi saððharmayaagee bæsa gænma kara vuu seeka."

## English translation ##
“The great elder, who exhibited the competence of an exalted teacher that could fully establish the
Dhamma in the island or make it widely spread upon it; who was like a light to the island of Lanka, spoke
the Dhamma at two locations as said [before](before.md), in the language of the people of the island, and thereby
instilled the real and true Dhamma in the people of Lanka.”


# What did they speak at mahinðaagamana #

It is obvious that the people did not speak Mahinda thera’s Maagadhi (Pali). More significantly, that is the very reason he spoke to them in their native language. We can well surmise that at that time the language of the natives was a language known to foreigners such as the visiting Mahinda Thera. Surely, he did not get a special tutor to teach him this language in anticipation of the historic trip. Lankans were pioneers in International trading. Oldest map of the world has Lanka’s size overblown, the only way its importance could be depicted. No doubt Lanka’s language had its place in the civilized world.

What was this language? The fact that Southern India is a semi-arid region of India and that nearby Lanka, just a swimming distance away, is a luscious island, suggests the direction of migration from India to Lanka. As such, it is tempting to believe that in the distant past, the islanders must have spoken some Dravidian dialect or the proto-Dravidian language. In short: Early settlers were from India; they spoke Dravidian; therefore, ancient Sinhala was Dravidian.

There are several assumptions made here: That during the prehistoric times when humans were just spreading around the world, Lanka did not have inhabitants, in spite of mainland India being so close. People did not come to Lanka in numbers until Dravidian became an established language system in India. The semi arid South India had a greater population density than the luscious island, and its people were actively looking to expand. And there was room and food in the empty island. We are mixing relatively recent conditions with very early days of human existence.

Couldn’t we also say that during the prehistoric days, there were more people living on the island than in the neighboring harsh climate and therefore they lived and thrived on the island? In that case Dravidian could have formed in Lanka and spread from there to India. Let’s keep that question in mind and go forward.

The inherent property of a people is said to be their language. When we say language, what enters our minds is the picture of letters and words. These are only artifacts. In nature, it is really the phonology (sound system) that defines the people. A phoneme of a language is a minimal unit of sound of a language that could be used to make words without ambiguity. There is a finite set of phonemes in each language.

# Phonology – the key #

The Sinhalese have a phoneme inventory of fewer than 40. (English has about 45). If you are a Sinhalese (as defined shortly), get hold of a hodiya and count (only) the distinct sounds you can naturally and effortlessly say. These are the sounds you heard as a child from your parents and the surrounding. They
are the indelible markers that intrinsically define you as a Sinhalese. Remember that this is not the same as the appellation Sinhalayaa. Anyone whose speech is confined to the Sinhala phonology is a Sinhalese.

As an adult, all foreign sounds you hear are readjusted to one out of this set, retained and uttered back.

Those sounds that do not come close to your phonemes are ignored. This is how the English accent happens. Just think about this yourself and test it in practice.

The following words are lossless transliterations from the Sinhala script into Romanized Sinhala. Transliterate them back to the Sinhala script if you need to. (That’s a good exercise on phonetics). Then think of how you would casually say them, naturally, easily, without hesitating.

Note: þ and p are different letters just as h and n are different.
Lekhanaya, pravûþi (news), karþû (author), ðhaatu (relics), heøa (Sinhala), hela (mountain), ðaµda (pole).

Chances are that you said those as follows:

Leekanaya, pravurþi, kaþruu, ðaaþu, hela, hela, ðanda.


# Who speaks mahapraaµa? #

Now you know that the average Sinhalese cannot pronounce mahapraaµa (aspirated) letters or Sanskrit iruyanna without consciously making an effort. Not even most Buddhist monks, whom we expect to be proficient in Pali, consistently say the mahapraaµas. We need to really think before uttering Sanskrit or Pali words. This is in spite that for centuries (they say since after 100 CE) we mixed-in Sanskrit to the formal writing. The above quote from Mahaavamsha has seven Sanskrit words, out of which we would consistently mispronounce four (aðhika, zaasþû, sþhavira and saððharmayaagee). Think why we correctly speak the balance three (aakaara, mahaa, janayaa). (Hint: Look at the personal phoneme inventory you just made).

# What? Muurdhaja? #

Most significant fact relevant to our inquiry is that muurðhaja (coronal) sounds are foreign to the Sinhalese. The word muurðhaja implies ‘born at the roof (high point, Sinhala: muðuna) of the mouth (the hard palate). In order to make a muurðhaja sound, one must curl the tongue backward (retroflex) or bend upward (coronal) so as the tip of the tongue touches the hard part of the palate. Try to say “ta” and “da” making tongue touch the palate. This is completely awkward for a Sinhalese to do.

The Sinhala hodiya has the same row of muurðhaja letters as all the Indic alphabets do. (ta, tha, da, dha µa). However, the Sinhalese pronounce them from a different point of articulation --the tip of the tongue touching the inner ridge of the gums of the upper front teeth same way as the English do. The Sinhalese never turn their tongue tips upward for any sound as many other Indo-Europeans do. The American does so for their r, which the Sinhalese ‘do not hear’. This is how bad Sinhalese are with muurðhaja.

In contrast, all languages in India, whether of Indo-Aryan (North), Austric (East) or Dravidian (South) origin, have muurðhaja letters and those speakers make these sounds effortlessly as expected. (Listen to an average Indian saying ‘thousand’ and ‘wedding’, closely paying attention to the pronunciation of the italicized places. (Leave out the call-center Indians. They have perfectly mastered American pronunciation). Most Northerners would aspirate the ‘th’ and all would make ‘dd’ in the retroflex fashion.

# Trapped in a sounds set #

Phonology is a relatively new subject in linguistics, that is, in western linguistics. The Indian gurus knew it all along. That is why we have syllabic writing.

One could say that the phonology of a people is the hardest to change – perhaps you could add to it but impossible to subtract. (We could not even add mahapraaµa having tried for 20 centuries). Taking an example from abroad, even after ten generations, the African Americans who were brought to America as slaves, though they completely lost their original native African languages, still retain the African accent. This could be observed among Vietnamese children whose native language is English. They retain a Vietnamese accent due to having spent childhood in Vietnamese-only neighborhoods.

Coming back to Lanka, the people were happy to leave the mahapraaµa-muurðhaja question in the temple. And the monks quietly let the Indian retroflex t and d slip back to Sinhala alveolars as there weren’t two different sets of t and d.
Fact: Any group of people as long as they live together retains the phonology and carries it forward generation to generation.

There are situations when speech changed. One case is the great vowel shift of English in England. Black Death causing people of different dialects to mix, Influence of French among the powerful etc. are thought to have caused it. Grimm's Law talks of consonant shifts in Germanic. Grimm’s Law is about language transformation inside one family of languages --Indo-European, not between two families of languages as that happened to the African Americans.  Even that could not extricate the black American speech peculiarity.

# Dravidian or not? #

Sinhala phonology stands absolutely unaffected by Dravidian sounds. This fact is borne out in the Sinhala Hodiya. Unlike all the Indic alphabets that uniformly contain Dravidian sounds, Sinhala is the only Indic alphabet that is completely devoid of letters for signature Dravidian sounds. Tamil has three Ns, two Rs and three Ls. The Sinhalese phonology registers only one N, one R and one L. The muurðhaja N and L are outside their current phoneme inventory. If we accept that they were present sometime in the past (since the hodiya has them), still we are left with the anomaly of T and D described above.

Supposing Sinhala was originally a Dravidian language, we would expect the t and d to be retained in Sinhala as retroflex like all Indian languages have. There is no conceivable reason a Dravidian Sinhala to singly shift from retroflex to alveolar when its entire set of sister languages retained the retroflex forms. On the other hand, I have not encountered a single Indo-European language outside of India whose t and d are retroflex.

This living fact alone is enough to discard both the propositions that Sinhala descended from Pali or was one time a Dravidian language. It certainly suggests that Sinhala has different roots than the Indian languages.

# Sanskrit connection #

Did we at one time have mahapraaµa and muurðhaja since we use Sinhala intermixed with Sanskrit and later lose it due to laxness of speech? Actually, the fact that people are uncaring about them is the best indicator that Sanskrit never descended from formal to the ordinary people’s language. The people never caught on to the snobbish practice. The reason is simple. Many Sanskrit sounds are ‘karµµakatuka ðükhoccaaraµa’ (Say it!) – hard on the ear and difficult to say. Isn’t that the problem that we have even today, especially a period when we rigorously go about sanskritizing (making new words using Sanskrit roots) Sinhala for prestige?

# Indo-European Cognates #

We are now confused as to the origin of Sinhala. Conclusively, it did not descend from any Indian language. Yet it has a large set of cognates (words of similar meanings and sounds) with them as well as with European and other Asian languages.

The peculiarity of the Sinhalese speaker is clear: Though Lanka is so close to India, while they speak a language that is demonstrably Indo-European, their speech lacks the signature sounds of Indian languages: the aspirate and retroflex consonants. Wilhelm Geiger said that Sinhala grammar is strangely different from other Indo-Aryan languages. M.W.S. de Silva said that for some unexplained reason, the Sinhalese employ words that have absolutely no relation to the Indian languages for things that are so fundamental to life such as body parts (oluva, kakula, kalava etc,) and water (vatura).

# Water and sugar #

Notice that the word vatura finds its cognates extremely far at the other end of the Indo-European horizon, the Germanic group: English (water), German (wasser), Dutch (water) etc. Another example is hakuru, sakuru, sakkara which cognate with English sugar, German zucker etc. (One might argue that sugar is etymologically traced to Persian (shakar) through Arabic. I’d say the Arabs picked it from Lanka and took it to Persia. (Recall Anðaree asking the king what was drying on the pæðura to which the king answered “sand” that led Anðaree to bring over his son and sorrow over the faked story of his wife’s death in order to enjoy the sugar, crying “uBee kateþ pas magee kateþ pas”? We could say that we manufactured cane sugar before anyone else). Also, Sanskrit does not have a cognate for it except the long shot zarkara meaning pebbles.

The problem is that Sinhala has plenty of Indo-European cognates but they are not exactly parallel with Indo-Aryan. Some are not related to Indo-Aryan but Germanic (vatura) and others perhaps Indo-Iranian (sakuru). The obvious inference is that Sinhala and Indo-Aryan have different parentage in the Indo-European scheme. In the absence of known intermediary phases, Sinhala might well be contemporaneous with Sanskrit directly descending from an older version that could even be the proto­Indo-European language itself.

# Mleccha or civilized #

Our mental block is that we think we had only yakku and nayi (mlecchas) before Vijaya came with his group. This is an affront to human intelligence.

Consider this: bhaðrinaaþ veeðavyaasa, the very sage who compiled the Vedas, i.e. its aaðikarþû, was a dark-skinned man from an island in the south. Which island in the south produces dark-skinned people? Then the oldest Brahmi inscriptions were found in Anuradhapura and South India, not North India. The past of Sinhala is a fascinating subject to be studied by academics that are not fearful of leaving the bosom of the Ivor Jennings tradition of hand-me-downs.

# An ancient language? #

The conspicuous absence of essential Dravidian phonological attributes in the Sinhala phonology obliges the likelihood (however incredulous it may sound) that Sinhala should be at least as old as Dravidian. Otherwise, the original people could have spoken a Dravidian language which is impossible given the phonological evidence to the contrary (no muurðhaja etc.). This also puts to rest the argument that Dravidian first happened in Lanka.

Further, there is no reason to believe that a tropical island was not inhabited too far from the appearance of man on earth. It is also not a stretch to say that such a place would have been a melting pot of a culture that could have given rise to a vibrant language. Abundance of vegetation, the ocean, rivers, mountains, outdoors temperatures throughout the year, people constantly immigrating; these are things that are conducive to the development of a culture and language with a sizeable vocabulary and a grammar of some structure. The Polynesians were supposed to have travelled past Lanka 50,000 years ago. Where did our Vedda brothers get their broad nose? Living in America, I can see a similar thing happening in front of my very eyes – this is only 300 years old. Imagine how fast things would go given the right conditions.

Shrikant Talageri analyzed the Rigveda, the oldest Hindu epic written by generations of Rhishis going back perhaps 5000 or more years and proved beyond doubt that Indo-European spread started from North India or thereabout. However, the earlier mentioned peculiarities of Sinhala could not be explained. I submit humbly that it is conceivable, though arguable, that it all started in little Lanka and sailed up and stopped in North India or Persia where it gathered in strength and as Talageri shows, spread out. For, which is conducive for intense human activity; harsh climate or a tropical island?
Talageri: A thorough examination, with an open mind, of the vocabulary and grammar of Sinhalese, will establish that Sinhalese represents a remnant of an archaic branch of Indo-European languages.

# Look ahead #

Senarath Paranavithana perhaps is right in saying original people of Sinhala speakers came from Upper Indus or, we might wonder if it happened in reverse direction. It is lamentable that we have permanently lost the scientists of the ilk of Paranavitana and now need to lean on novelists and globalize businessmen from the west as our great (white) sponsors.
As you may have now realized, the answer to the question of the origin of your language was literally right under your nose! We started with the question, ‘Who gave us Sinhala”. The answer could be, “Nobody”, that it is a nixpanna bhaaxaa, a self sprung language. Whatever it is, let’s do the best to conserve the language for, the people in the back country still speak it exclusively.
Concluded.

# Non-English Latin letters used in Romanized Sinhala: #

These were carefully selected over three years of testing to optimize intuitive use of QWERTY keyboard for Sinhala when extended to US-International keyboard. It allows touch-typing Sinhala as fast as English.
æ = the sound of ‘a’ in hat. Kæþþa: sickle
û = iruyanna. The Sanskrit sound used in the word pravûþi: news. It’s a vowel!
ñ = Kanthaja naasikyaya. The nasal sound related to kayanna. sañgha: the monks
ç = þaaluja naasikyaya. maççokkaa: manioc, casava
µ = muurðhaja nayanna. µaya: debt
þ = aghoxa ðanþaja sparxaakxaraya. þaaþþaa: father (þ is the single hardest letter to learn)
ð = ghoxa ðanþaja sparzaakxaraya. ðaþa: tooth
z = þaaluja sayanna. vizexa :special
x= muurðhaja sayanna. See above for example
ø = muurðhaja layanna. sihaøa, heøa: Sinhala
á, í, ú, é, ó = binðuva, anusvaraya. lákaava, lí vaþura: well water, sú karanavaa: destroy, geé geta: house to house, koó gaha: a tree
æ’ = bæ’kuva: bank. This is the only Sinhala sound that RS cannot do as one letter. However, the Sinhala smartfont renders it perfectly in the Sinhala script ä, ï, ü, ë, ö = visargaya (binðu ðeka). ðükha: difficult, anþäpura: female apartments

Majority of these are actually needed only for words borrowed from Sanskrit. Most of us still cannot write Cream Cracker correctly in Sinhala. Romanized Sinhala helps overcome these difficulties and understand subjects of grammar such as sanðhi. Correctness of anything written could be tested using a smartfont that displays romanized Sinhala in the traditional script.

Romanized Sinhala is an adaptation of Old English (Anglo-Saxon) because the two phonologies are much similar. Ash (æ), Thorn (þ) and Edth (ð), the three letters indispensable for Sinhala are gifts from Anglo-Saxon to Sinhala. Other letters were assigned to Sinhala sounds after careful consideration of position on the keyboard for intuitive selection etc.
