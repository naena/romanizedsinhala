= Download =
 * Get the latest Keyboard for your Operating System: http://code.google.com/p/romanizedsinhala/downloads/list?q=label:Type-Archive
 *  To display real Sinhala letters you will need to install the font: http://romanizedsinhala.googlecode.com/files/Suriyakumara.ttf

= Language Bar = 
 * Customize [LanguageBar]

= Notepad = 

If you are with me so far...

 * Open Notepad. 
 * Change the Keyboard to Sinhala (Sri Lanka) in Vista or Uzbek (Latin) in XP. The reason why in Windows XP, you will see Uzbek is because in XP we don't have a built-in entry for Sinhala as a language. So I had to choose something else. 

  * v = press v
  * i = press i 
  * k = press k 
  * t = press w
  * a = press a
  * r = press r

(we are still good - haven't pressed any Alt combination yet!) 

  * g = press g
  * u = press u 
  * µ = press Right Alt + n  

(this is the "alternative" n, makes sense right?)

  * a = press a
  * s = press s
  * e = press e
  * e = press e
  * k = press k 
  * a = press a
  * r = press r
  * a = press a

(we just had to press one Alt key combination)

 * You have now typed the following following: 
{{{

}}}
